| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2013-4854] The RFC 5011 implementation in rdata.c in ISC BIND 9.7.x and 9.8.x before 9.8.5-P2, 9.8.6b1, 9.9.x before 9.9.3-P2, and 9.9.4b1, and DNSco BIND 9.9.3-S1 before 9.9.3-S1-P1 and 9.9.4-S1b1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named daemon exit) via a query with a malformed RDATA section that is not properly handled during construction of a log message, as exploited in the wild in July 2013.
| [CVE-2013-3919] resolver.c in ISC BIND 9.8.5 before 9.8.5-P1, 9.9.3 before 9.9.3-P1, and 9.6-ESV-R9 before 9.6-ESV-R9-P1, when a recursive resolver is configured, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named daemon exit) via a query for a record in a malformed zone.
| [CVE-2013-2266] libdns in ISC BIND 9.7.x and 9.8.x before 9.8.4-P2, 9.8.5 before 9.8.5b2, 9.9.x before 9.9.2-P2, and 9.9.3 before 9.9.3b2 on UNIX platforms allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a memory-exhaustion attack against a machine running a named process.
| [CVE-2012-5689] ISC BIND 9.8.x through 9.8.4-P1 and 9.9.x through 9.9.2-P1, in certain configurations involving DNS64 with a Response Policy Zone that lacks an AAAA rewrite rule, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named daemon exit) via a query for an AAAA record.
| [CVE-2012-5688] ISC BIND 9.8.x before 9.8.4-P1 and 9.9.x before 9.9.2-P1, when DNS64 is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a crafted query.
| [CVE-2012-5166] ISC BIND 9.x before 9.7.6-P4, 9.8.x before 9.8.3-P4, 9.9.x before 9.9.1-P4, and 9.4-ESV and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R7-P4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named daemon hang) via unspecified combinations of resource records.
| [CVE-2012-4244] ISC BIND 9.x before 9.7.6-P3, 9.8.x before 9.8.3-P3, 9.9.x before 9.9.1-P3, and 9.4-ESV and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R7-P3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named daemon exit) via a query for a long resource record.
| [CVE-2012-1667] ISC BIND 9.x before 9.7.6-P1, 9.8.x before 9.8.3-P1, 9.9.x before 9.9.1-P1, and 9.4-ESV and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R7-P1 does not properly handle resource records with a zero-length RDATA section, which allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or data corruption) or obtain sensitive information from process memory via a crafted record.
| [CVE-2012-1033] The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack.
| [CVE-2011-4313] query.c in ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.6.x, 9.4-ESV through 9.4-ESV-R5, 9.6-ESV through 9.6-ESV-R5, 9.7.0 through 9.7.4, 9.8.0 through 9.8.1, and 9.9.0a1 through 9.9.0b1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and named exit) via unknown vectors related to recursive DNS queries, error logging, and the caching of an invalid record by the resolver.
| [CVE-2011-2465] Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9 9.8.0, 9.8.0-P1, 9.8.0-P2, and 9.8.1b1, when recursion is enabled and the Response Policy Zone (RPZ) contains DNAME or certain CNAME records, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named daemon crash) via an unspecified query.
| [CVE-2011-2464] Unspecified vulnerability in ISC BIND 9 9.6.x before 9.6-ESV-R4-P3, 9.7.x before 9.7.3-P3, and 9.8.x before 9.8.0-P4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named daemon crash) via a crafted UPDATE request.
| [CVE-2011-1910] Off-by-one error in named in ISC BIND 9.x before 9.7.3-P1, 9.8.x before 9.8.0-P2, 9.4-ESV before 9.4-ESV-R4-P1, and 9.6-ESV before 9.6-ESV-R4-P1 allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a negative response containing large RRSIG RRsets.
| [CVE-2011-1907] ISC BIND 9.8.x before 9.8.0-P1, when Response Policy Zones (RPZ) RRset replacement is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via an RRSIG query.
| [CVE-2010-1567] The SIP implementation on the Cisco PGW 2200 Softswitch with software before 9.8(1)S5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device crash) via a malformed header, aka Bug ID CSCsz13590.

| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-4211] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.0.3 allows remote authenticated users with the insert right to save certain flags via a (1) COPY or (2) APPEND command.
| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."
| [CVE-2006-5973] Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.
| [CVE-2006-2502] Stack-based buffer overflow in pop3d in Cyrus IMAPD (cyrus-imapd) 2.3.2, when the popsubfolders option is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long USER command.
| [CVE-2006-2414] Directory traversal vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0 beta and 1.0 allows remote attackers to list files and directories under the mbox parent directory and obtain mailbox names via ".." sequences in the (1) LIST or (2) DELETE IMAP command.
| [CVE-2006-0730] Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Dovecot before 1.0beta3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or hang) via unspecified vectors involving (1) "potential hangs" in the APPEND command and "potential crashes" in (2) dovecot-auth and (3) imap/pop3-login.  NOTE: vector 2 might be related to a double free vulnerability.
| [CVE-2002-0925] Format string vulnerability in mmsyslog function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the USER command to mmpop3d for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, (2) the HELO command to mmsmtpd for mmmail 0.0.13 and earlier, or (3) the USER command to mmftpd 0.0.7 and earlier.
| [CVE-2001-0143] vpop3d program in linuxconf 1.23r and earlier allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2000-1197] POP2 or POP3 server (pop3d) in imap-uw IMAP package on FreeBSD and other operating systems creates lock files with predictable names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (lack of mail access) for other users by creating lock files for other mail boxes.
| [CVE-1999-1445] Vulnerability in imapd and ipop3d in Slackware 3.4 and 3.3 with shadowing enabled, and possibly other operating systems, allows remote attackers to cause a core dump via a short sequence of USER and PASS commands that do not provide valid usernames or passwords.

| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2009-2632] Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
| [CVE-2011-4318] Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.16, when ssl or starttls is enabled and hostname is used to define the proxy destination, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate for a different hostname.
| [CVE-2011-3481] The index_get_ids function in index.c in imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server before 2.4.11, when server-side threading is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted References header in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2011-3372] imap/nntpd.c in the NNTP server (nntpd) for Cyrus IMAPd 2.4.x before 2.4.12 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending an AUTHINFO USER command without sending an additional AUTHINFO PASS command.
| [CVE-2011-2167] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the chroot configuration setting, which might allow remote authenticated users to conduct directory traversal attacks by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-2166] script-login in Dovecot 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not follow the user and group configuration settings, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a script.
| [CVE-2011-1929] lib-mail/message-header-parser.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.17 and 2.0.x before 2.0.13 does not properly handle '\0' characters in header names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash or mailbox corruption) via a crafted e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-4011] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.5 10H574 does not properly manage memory for user names, which allows remote authenticated users to read the private e-mail of other persons in opportunistic circumstances via standard e-mail clients accessing a user's own mailbox, related to a "memory aliasing issue."
| [CVE-2010-3780] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (master process outage) by simultaneously disconnecting many (1) IMAP or (2) POP3 sessions.
| [CVE-2010-3779] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.beta2 grants the admin permission to the owner of each mailbox in a non-public namespace, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by changing the ACL of a mailbox, as demonstrated by a symlinked shared mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3707] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving more specific entries that occur after less specific entries, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3706] plugins/acl/acl-backend-vfile.c in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.15 and 2.0.x before 2.0.5 interprets an ACL entry as a directive to add to the permissions granted by another ACL entry, instead of a directive to replace the permissions granted by another ACL entry, in certain circumstances involving the private namespace of a user, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a request to read or modify a mailbox.
| [CVE-2010-3304] The ACL plugin in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.13 propagates INBOX ACLs to newly created mailboxes in certain configurations, which might allow remote attackers to read mailboxes that have unintended weak ACLs.
| [CVE-2010-0745] Unspecified vulnerability in Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via long headers in an e-mail message.
| [CVE-2010-0535] Dovecot in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when Kerberos is enabled, does not properly enforce the service access control list (SACL) for sending and receiving e-mail, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.
| [CVE-2010-0433] The kssl_keytab_is_available function in ssl/kssl.c in OpenSSL before 0.9.8n, when Kerberos is enabled but Kerberos configuration files cannot be opened, does not check a certain return value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via SSL cipher negotiation, as demonstrated by a chroot installation of Dovecot or stunnel without Kerberos configuration files inside the chroot.
| [CVE-2009-3897] Dovecot 1.2.x before 1.2.8 sets 0777 permissions during creation of certain directories at installation time, which allows local users to access arbitrary user accounts by replacing the auth socket, related to the parent directories of the base_dir directory, and possibly the base_dir directory itself.
| [CVE-2009-3235] Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Sieve plugin in Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, as derived from Cyrus libsieve, allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted SIEVE script, as demonstrated by forwarding an e-mail message to a large number of recipients, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-2632.
| [CVE-2008-5301] Directory traversal vulnerability in the ManageSieve implementation in Dovecot 1.0.15, 1.1, and 1.2 allows remote attackers to read and modify arbitrary .sieve files via a ".." (dot dot) in a script name.
| [CVE-2008-4907] The message parsing feature in Dovecot 1.1.4 and 1.1.5, when using the FETCH ENVELOPE command in the IMAP client, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent crash) via an email with a malformed From address, which triggers an assertion error, aka "invalid message address parsing bug."
| [CVE-2008-4870] dovecot 1.0.7 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5, and possibly Fedora, uses world-readable permissions for dovecot.conf, which allows local users to obtain the ssl_key_password parameter value.
| [CVE-2008-4578] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using the "k" right to create unauthorized "parent/child/child" mailboxes.
| [CVE-2008-4577] The ACL plugin in Dovecot before 1.1.4 treats negative access rights as if they are positive access rights, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
| [CVE-2008-1218] Argument injection vulnerability in Dovecot 1.0.x before 1.0.13, and 1.1.x before 1.1.rc3, when using blocking passdbs, allows remote attackers to bypass the password check via a password containing TAB characters, which are treated as argument delimiters that enable the skip_password_check field to be specified.
| [CVE-2008-1199] Dovecot before 1.0.11, when configured to use mail_extra_groups to allow Dovecot to create dotlocks in /var/mail, might allow local users to read sensitive mail files for other users, or modify files or directories that are writable by group, via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2007-6598] Dovecot before 1.0.10, with certain configuration options including use of %variables, does not properly maintain the LDAP+auth cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to login as a different user who has the same password.
| [CVE-2007-5794] Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
| [CVE-2007-5740] The format string protection mechanism in IMAPD for Perdition Mail Retrieval Proxy 1.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP tag with a null byte followed by a format string specifier, which is not counted by the mechanism.
| [CVE-2007-5018] Stack-based buffer overflow in IMAPD in Mercury/32 4.52 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long argument in a SEARCH ON command.  NOTE: this issue might overlap with CVE-2004-1211.

| [CVE-2007-2231] Directory traversal vulnerability in index/mbox/mbox-storage.c in Dovecot before 1.0.rc29, when using the zlib plugin, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary gzipped (.gz) mailboxes (mbox files) via a .. (dot dot) sequence in the mailbox name.
| [CVE-2007-2173] Eval injection vulnerability in (1) courier-imapd.indirect and (2) courier-pop3d.indirect in Courier-IMAP before 4.0.6-r2, and 4.1.x before 4.1.2-r1, on Gentoo Linux allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the XMAILDIR variable, related to the LOGINRUN variable.
| [CVE-2007-1579] Stack-based buffer overflow in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a certain SUBSCRIBE command.
| [CVE-2007-1578] Multiple integer signedness errors in the NTLM implementation in Atrium MERCUR IMAPD (mcrimap4.exe) 5.00.14, with SP4, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long NTLMSSP argument that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow.
| [CVE-2007-0618] Unspecified vulnerability in (1) pop3d, (2) pop3ds, (3) imapd, and (4) imapds in IBM AIX 5.3.0 has unspecified impact and attack vectors, involving an "authentication vulnerability."

| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-5671] Heap-based buffer overflow in the dkim_exim_query_dns_txt function in dkim.c in Exim 4.70 through 4.80, when DKIM support is enabled and acl_smtp_connect and acl_smtp_rcpt are not set to "warn control = dkim_disable_verify," allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an email from a malicious DNS server.
| [CVE-2012-0478] The texImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 11.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, Thunderbird 5.0 through 11.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.9 does not properly restrict JSVAL_TO_OBJECT casts, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page.
| [CVE-2011-1764] Format string vulnerability in the dkim_exim_verify_finish function in src/dkim.c in Exim before 4.76 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in data used in DKIM logging, as demonstrated by an identity field containing a % (percent) character.
| [CVE-2011-1407] The DKIM implementation in Exim 4.7x before 4.76 permits matching for DKIM identities to apply to lookup items, instead of only strings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access a filesystem via a crafted identity.
| [CVE-2011-0017] The open_log function in log.c in Exim 4.72 and earlier does not check the return value from (1) setuid or (2) setgid system calls, which allows local users to append log data to arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2010-4345] Exim 4.72 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging the ability of the exim user account to specify an alternate configuration file with a directive that contains arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the spool_directory directive.
| [CVE-2010-4344] Heap-based buffer overflow in the string_vformat function in string.c in Exim before 4.70 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an SMTP session that includes two MAIL commands in conjunction with a large message containing crafted headers, leading to improper rejection logging.
| [CVE-2010-2024] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when MBX locking is enabled, allows local users to change permissions of arbitrary files or create arbitrary files, and cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges, via a symlink attack on a lockfile in /tmp/.
| [CVE-2010-2023] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when a world-writable sticky-bit mail directory is used, does not verify the st_nlink field of mailbox files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard link to another user's file.
| [CVE-2006-1251] Argument injection vulnerability in greylistclean.cron in sa-exim 4.2 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via an email with a To field that contains a filename separated by whitespace, which is not quoted when greylistclean.cron provides the argument to the rm command.
| [CVE-2005-0022] Buffer overflow in the spa_base64_to_bits function in Exim before 4.43, as originally obtained from Samba code, and as called by the auth_spa_client function, may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code during SPA authentication.
| [CVE-2005-0021] Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components, as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse function.
| [CVE-2004-0400] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 4 before 4.33, when the headers_check_syntax option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during the header check.
| [CVE-2004-0399] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 3.35, and other versions before 4, when the sender_verify option is true, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during sender verification.
| [CVE-2003-0743] Heap-based buffer overflow in smtp_in.c for Exim 3 (exim3) before 3.36 and Exim 4 (exim4) before 4.21 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an invalid (1) HELO or (2) EHLO argument with a large number of spaces followed by a NULL character and a newline, which is not properly trimmed before the "(no argument given)" string is appended to the buffer.
| [CVE-2002-1381] Format string vulnerability in daemon.c for Exim 4.x through 4.10, and 3.x through 3.36, allows exim administrative users to execute arbitrary code by modifying the pid_file_path value.

| MITRE CVE - https://cve.mitre.org:
| [CVE-2012-5671] Heap-based buffer overflow in the dkim_exim_query_dns_txt function in dkim.c in Exim 4.70 through 4.80, when DKIM support is enabled and acl_smtp_connect and acl_smtp_rcpt are not set to "warn control = dkim_disable_verify," allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an email from a malicious DNS server.
| [CVE-2012-0478] The texImage2D implementation in the WebGL subsystem in Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 11.0, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, Thunderbird 5.0 through 11.0, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.9 does not properly restrict JSVAL_TO_OBJECT casts, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted web page.
| [CVE-2011-1764] Format string vulnerability in the dkim_exim_verify_finish function in src/dkim.c in Exim before 4.76 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in data used in DKIM logging, as demonstrated by an identity field containing a % (percent) character.
| [CVE-2011-1407] The DKIM implementation in Exim 4.7x before 4.76 permits matching for DKIM identities to apply to lookup items, instead of only strings, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access a filesystem via a crafted identity.
| [CVE-2011-0017] The open_log function in log.c in Exim 4.72 and earlier does not check the return value from (1) setuid or (2) setgid system calls, which allows local users to append log data to arbitrary files via a symlink attack.
| [CVE-2010-4345] Exim 4.72 and earlier allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging the ability of the exim user account to specify an alternate configuration file with a directive that contains arbitrary commands, as demonstrated by the spool_directory directive.
| [CVE-2010-4344] Heap-based buffer overflow in the string_vformat function in string.c in Exim before 4.70 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an SMTP session that includes two MAIL commands in conjunction with a large message containing crafted headers, leading to improper rejection logging.
| [CVE-2010-2024] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when MBX locking is enabled, allows local users to change permissions of arbitrary files or create arbitrary files, and cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges, via a symlink attack on a lockfile in /tmp/.
| [CVE-2010-2023] transports/appendfile.c in Exim before 4.72, when a world-writable sticky-bit mail directory is used, does not verify the st_nlink field of mailbox files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges by creating a hard link to another user's file.
| [CVE-2006-1251] Argument injection vulnerability in greylistclean.cron in sa-exim 4.2 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via an email with a To field that contains a filename separated by whitespace, which is not quoted when greylistclean.cron provides the argument to the rm command.
| [CVE-2005-0022] Buffer overflow in the spa_base64_to_bits function in Exim before 4.43, as originally obtained from Samba code, and as called by the auth_spa_client function, may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code during SPA authentication.
| [CVE-2005-0021] Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components, as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse function.
| [CVE-2004-0400] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 4 before 4.33, when the headers_check_syntax option is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during the header check.
| [CVE-2004-0399] Stack-based buffer overflow in Exim 3.35, and other versions before 4, when the sender_verify option is true, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code during sender verification.
| [CVE-2003-0743] Heap-based buffer overflow in smtp_in.c for Exim 3 (exim3) before 3.36 and Exim 4 (exim4) before 4.21 may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an invalid (1) HELO or (2) EHLO argument with a large number of spaces followed by a NULL character and a newline, which is not properly trimmed before the "(no argument given)" string is appended to the buffer.
| [CVE-2002-1381] Format string vulnerability in daemon.c for Exim 4.x through 4.10, and 3.x through 3.36, allows exim administrative users to execute arbitrary code by modifying the pid_file_path value.
