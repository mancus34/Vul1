CVE-2013-0198	53	Dnsmasq before 2.66test2, when used with certain libvirt configurations, replies to queries from prohibited interfaces, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via spoofed TCP based DNS queries.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-3411.
CVE-2012-3411	53	Dnsmasq before 2.63test1, when used with certain libvirt configurations, replies to requests from prohibited interfaces, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed DNS query.
CVE-2009-2958	53	The tftp_request function in tftp.c in dnsmasq before 2.50, when --enable-tftp is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a TFTP read (aka RRQ) request with a malformed blksize option.
CVE-2009-2957	53	Heap-based buffer overflow in the tftp_request function in tftp.c in dnsmasq before 2.50, when --enable-tftp is used, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename in a TFTP packet, as demonstrated by a read (aka RRQ) request.
CVE-2008-3350	53	dnsmasq 2.43 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by (1) sending a DHCPINFORM while lacking a DHCP lease, or (2) attempting to renew a nonexistent DHCP lease for an invalid subnet as an "unknown client," a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3214.
CVE-2008-3214	53	dnsmasq 2.25 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by (1) renewing a nonexistent lease or (2) sending a DHCPREQUEST for an IP address that is not in the same network, related to the DHCP NAK response from the daemon.
CVE-2006-2017	53	Dnsmasq 2.29 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a DHCP client broadcast reply request.
CVE-2005-0877	53	Dnsmasq before 2.21 allows remote attackers to poison the DNS cache via answers to queries that were not made by Dnsmasq.
CVE-2005-0876	53	Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dnsmasq before 2.21 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via the DHCP lease file.
CVE-2012-5960	49152	Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique_service_name function in ssdp/ssdp_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long UDN (aka upnp:rootdevice) field in a UDP packet.
CVE-2012-5959	49152	Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique_service_name function in ssdp/ssdp_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long UDN (aka uuid) field within a string that contains a :: (colon colon) in a UDP packet.
CVE-2012-5958	49152	Stack-based buffer overflow in the unique_service_name function in ssdp/ssdp_server.c in the SSDP parser in the portable SDK for UPnP Devices (aka libupnp, formerly the Intel SDK for UPnP devices) before 1.6.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a UDP packet with a crafted string that is not properly handled after a certain pointer subtraction.
